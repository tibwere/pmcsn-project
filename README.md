Term paper of "Performance Modeling of Computer Systems &amp; Networks" class (A.Y. 2020/21)

## Structure

In the `doc` folder there are:
  - The main latex file for the report ([report.tex](doc/report.tex))
  - All chapters included, stored in `doc/chapters` folder
  - All figures used, stored in `doc/figs` folder, organized as follows:
    - `doc/figs/plots` contains plots (`.png` files) and raw data (`.csv` files into `data` subdirectory)
    - `doc/figs/raw` contains `.drawio` files used to generate `.png` of graphs 
    - `doc/figs/screnshoots` contains all screenshots for _Verifica_ phases (base and improved simulator)
    - `doc/figs` contains all other images used (mainly graphs generated using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/))

In the `src` folder there are:
  - Our source files ([simul.c](src/simul.c), [improved_simul.c](src/improved_simul.c) e [utils.c](src/utils.c))
  - The source files provided by Leemis and Park, authors of _"Discrete Event Simulation, A first course"_ necessary for compilation ([rngs.c](src/rngs.c), [rvgs.c](src/rvgs.c) e [rvms.c](src/rvms.c))
  - The source files provided by Leemis and Park, authors of _"Discrete Event Simulation, A first course"_ useful for inferring statistics ([estimate.c](src/estimate.c) and [uvs.c](src/uvs.c))

In the `include` folder there are:
  - Our header file ([utils.h](include/utils.h))
  - The header files provided by Leemis and Park, authors of _"Discrete Event Simulation, A first course"_ necessary for compilation ([rngs.h](include/rngs.h), [rvgs.h](include/rvgs.h) e [rvms.h](include/rvms.h))

`bin` and `obj` folders, that contains respectively object and executable files, are automatically generated by the compilation rules

## Compile rules

### C files

To generate the executable files you have to move into the root directory (where there is the [Makefile](Makefile)) and execute one or more of the following commands:
  - Compile the base version of the simulator (__simul__):
    ```[bash]
    make [simulator]
    ``` 
  - Compile the improved version of the simulator (**improved_simul**):
    ```[bash]
    make improved_simulator
    ```
  - Compile __estimate__ program:
    ```[bash]
    make estimate
    ```
  - Compile __uvs__ program:
    ```[bash]
    make uvs
    ```
  - To perform all the above rules:
    ```[bash]
    make all
    ```
Therefore:
  - To remove the `obj` folder, run
    ```[bash] 
    make clean 
    ``` 
    
  - To remove both `obj` and `bin` folders, run
    ```[bash] 
    make clean-all 
    ```
    
### Latex files
To generate PDF version of report you have to move into the `doc` directory and execute the following command:
```[bash]
latexmk -pdf -silent report.tex
```
